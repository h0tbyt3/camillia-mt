// Spell suggestions for the compose box: is a word known, and if not, which
// known words is it most likely a typo of.
//
// Free of Arduino and LVGL so tests/test_spell.cpp can check it on the host.
// The English word list is compiled in by tools/gen_spell_dict.py and reached
// through spell::english(), which lives in spell_en.cpp -- a separate file so
// the tests can hand the engine a dictionary of their own.
//
// Dictionary format (what gen_spell_dict.py writes, what the engine reads).
// Words are lowercase ASCII letters plus the apostrophe, sorted by bytes, and
// front-coded: each entry stores only what differs from the word before it.
//   entry  = H [L] suffix... F
//   H      = (shared prefix length << 4) | suffix length, both 0..15. A suffix
//            of 15 or more writes 15 here and the real length in the byte L.
//   F      = frequency, 0 (rarest) .. 255 (most common), log-scaled.
// Every kBlockWords-th entry starts a block and stores its word in full
// (prefix 0), and blocks[] holds each block's byte offset, so a lookup is a
// binary search over blocks and a short scan inside one -- straight from
// flash, nothing unpacked into RAM.
