"""Rebuilds dict/en.txt, the English word list behind compose spell suggestions.

A maintainer tool, run by hand when the list should change -- the build only
reads dict/en.txt (see tools/gen_spell_dict.py). Needs network access.

Source: hermitdave/FrequencyWords, en_50k (OpenSubtitles 2018 word counts),
https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords -- content CC-BY-SA-4.0, so
dict/en.txt is under that licence too and says so in its header.

A frequency list rather than a dictionary because suggestions need an order:
of all the words one or two edits from a typo, the most common one is the best
guess. Subtitle counts also track how people actually write to each other,
which is closer to mesh chat than a newspaper corpus is.

Cleaning:
  - FRAGMENTS are dropped, and MESH_WORDS added.
  - letters only: the corpus splits "don't" into "don" + "'t", so the
    apostrophe entries are fragments. Contractions are added from CONTRACTIONS.
  - MISSPELLINGS are dropped: they are frequent in the corpus (people type
    "alot") and a word in the list is never flagged. Taken from the hits of
    Wikipedia's "Lists of common misspellings/For machines" in the top 30k, plus
    the apostrophe-less contractions.
  - 2..20 letters. Single letters are never checked, and nothing longer is
    worth the bytes.

Usage:  python3 tools/build_spell_wordlist.py [--words 25000] [--src en_50k.txt]
        (--src reads a downloaded copy; for Pythons without a CA bundle)
